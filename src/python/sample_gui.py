# We use PySide2 to create qt objects owned by python and integrate them into our native gui
# by using the QtWidgets.QApplication.instance() reference.
# If you think this is a hack have a look at:
# https://help.autodesk.com/view/3DSMAX/2017/ENU/?guid=__developer_using_pyside_html
# The gui module does the retrieval of the application instance as well as native gui elements for us.
from PySide2 import QtWidgets, QtCore

# Gui objects which should exist throughout the lifetime of the addon
# should be declared as global variables because otherwise the
# python owned object is destroyed while still being referenced from the native gui.
# The global scope of the addon module is retained for the lifetime of the application, because
# the interpreter is only started up and torn down with application start / exit.

# Our python side onclick callback
def onclick():

# Load is invoked by the native code when the addon is requested to be loaded by the user.

    QtCore.QObject.connect(action, QtCore.SIGNAL('triggered()'), onclick)  # USE THIS
    # action.triggered.connect(onclick)  # NOT THIS, leaks memory.


# Unload is invoked by the native code when the addon is requested to be unloaded by the user
# It should perform cleanup such as removing gui elements.
# Note that the global scope of the module is currently still retained in memory after unload has been called because
# cpython does not offer a mechanism to unimport a module without tearing down the whole interpreter instance.

    # !IMPORTANT! Call deleteLater() for qt objects created by python, otherwise memory leaks!

# You can define logic at module level. This logic will be invoked when the module is imported.
# This happens once for the lifetime of the application when the module is requested to be loaded by the user
# and is immediately followed by a call to load().
